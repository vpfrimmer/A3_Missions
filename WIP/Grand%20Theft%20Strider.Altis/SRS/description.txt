general idea behind SRS:

on each client there is a local "setVariable" for each player named ["%1_VAR",_unitString]
which contains the information such as KO, Healing, Dragging, Etc (see unitVarInit)

for each unit we setup a publicVariableEventHandler which detects when changes to this variable have been made.
When it triggers, the local variable is updated with the values from the public one.

primary method for broadcasting new variables is the SRS_fnc_unitVarSetter, which reassigns the public
variable and broadcasts the changes if requested.

TODO:

    * blood on player when downed
*   * black screen transitions for camera & down->up
    * unco screen similar to BTC
