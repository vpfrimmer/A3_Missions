# A3_Missions
These are some of the missions I made for my Arma 3 community : Gr√®ce de Canards.

## This repository
"Published" contains completed and working missions.
"WIP" contains unfinished and/or unplayable missions. These will be put in Published when done.

## Why did you put this here ?

In the name of science !
To be true, these missions are here in case of any fellow mission maker should like to take a peek at how my missions are done. So it's mainly for my community, as it can provide great support when teaching to mission making beginners.

## What do I need to run those missions ?

### Technical settings
These missions are designed to be played without any respawn, because that's how we play. There's never any Zeus or MCC or any kind of game mastering thingy involved. Loadouts are hard-coded, as are objectives and tasks.
For some, you may have to connect a headless client to your server.

Also, the texts inside these missions are written in french.

### Modset
These missions have been built using the latest GdC modset. As of 03/29/17, it consists of :
